"""Shared GradCache machinery (https://huggingface.co/papers/2101.06983).

A "cached" loss trades compute for memory in three steps:

    (1) a quick embedding step without gradients/computation graphs, to get all the embeddings.
    (2) calculate the loss, backward up to the embeddings, and cache the gradients wrt. the embeddings.
    (3) a 2nd embedding step with gradients/computation graphs, connecting the cached gradients into
        the backward chain.

Only one mini-batch of activations is alive at a time in (1) and (3), which is what bounds the memory.
The second forward pass reproduces the first exactly by replaying its RNG state (:class:`RandContext`),
so dropout draws the same masks and the cached gradients belong to the embeddings they are applied to.

:class:`CachedLossMixin` implements all of this. A loss only has to provide ``calculate_loss``.
