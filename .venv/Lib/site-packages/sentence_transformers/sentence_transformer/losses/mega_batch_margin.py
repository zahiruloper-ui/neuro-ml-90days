        Given a large batch (like 500 or more examples) of (anchor_i, positive_i) pairs, find for each pair in the batch
        the hardest negative, i.e. find j != i such that cos_sim(anchor_i, positive_j) is maximal. Then create from this a
        triplet (anchor_i, positive_i, positive_j) where positive_j serves as the negative for this triplet.

        Then train as with the triplet loss.

        Args:
            model: SentenceTransformerModel
            positive_margin: Positive margin, cos(anchor, positive)
                should be > positive_margin
            negative_margin: Negative margin, cos(anchor, negative)
                should be < negative_margin
            use_mini_batched_version: As large batch sizes require a lot
                of memory, we can use a mini-batched version that only
                keeps one mini-batch of activations alive at a time
                (GradCache, https://huggingface.co/papers/2101.06983).
                This does not change the loss or the gradient, but it
                embeds every input twice, so it trades roughly a 2x
                slowdown for the memory saving. It is not compatible
                with a model based on a :class:`~sentence_transformers.sentence_transformer.modules.StaticEmbedding`,
                whose inputs have no batch dimension to split along.
            mini_batch_size: Size for the mini-batches. It does not have
                to divide the batch size in your data loader. It bounds
                both the activation memory of the embedding steps and the
                size of the similarity matrix used to mine the hardest
                negatives, so lower it if you run out of memory.
            mini_batch_num_tokens: If set, the embedding mini-batches are packed by total (non-padding)
                token count instead of by ``mini_batch_size`` sequences, which speeds up training on
                variable-length data. Most effective for models that avoid padded compute, e.g. flash
                attention with input flattening. See the Speeding up Inference documentation for details.
            show_progress_bar: If True, a progress bar for the
                mini-batches is shown during training. The default is
                False.

        Requirements:
            1. (anchor, positive) pairs
            2. Large batches (500 or more examples)

        Inputs:
            +---------------------------------------+--------+
            | Inputs                                | Labels |
            +=======================================+========+
            | (anchor, positive) pairs              | none   |
            +---------------------------------------+--------+

        Recommendations:
            - Use ``BatchSamplers.NO_DUPLICATES`` (:class:`docs <sentence_transformers.base.sampler.BatchSamplers>`) to
              ensure that no in-batch negatives are duplicates of the anchor or positive samples.

        Relations:
            - The hardest negative is mined from the other positives in the batch, so the batch size directly
              determines the quality of the negatives. ``use_mini_batched_version=True`` is what lets you raise it.
