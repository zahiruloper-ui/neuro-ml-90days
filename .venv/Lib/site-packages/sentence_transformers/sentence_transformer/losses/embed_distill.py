        """
        Computes an embedding-distillation loss between the student model's embeddings
        and pre-computed teacher embeddings (passed as labels). For each input text column
        in a batch, the student's embedding is compared against a teacher embedding via
        the chosen distance metric, and the per-column losses are averaged.

        This is the embedding-matching component from the EmbedDistill paper (Eq. 7/8).
        It is offline-only by design: the user pre-computes teacher embeddings (with the
        right teacher prompts, settings, etc.) and stores them as a ``label`` column in
        the dataset.

        Args:
            model: The student SentenceTransformer model to be trained.
            distance_metric: How to compare student and teacher embeddings. One of
                ``"cosine"`` (1 - cosine_similarity, bounded), ``"l2"`` (Euclidean
                distance, the metric used in the EmbedDistill paper), or ``"mse"``
                (mean squared error). Defaults to ``"cosine"``.
            projection_dim: If set, adds a learnable ``nn.Linear(student_dim, projection_dim)``
                that maps student embeddings into the teacher's embedding space before the
                distance is computed. Use this when the student and teacher have different
                embedding dimensions. The projection layer lives on the loss and gets trained
                alongside the student. By default it is not persisted with the saved model.
                Use `save_projection` / `load_projection` to reuse it across runs, e.g. for
                multi-stage training. Defaults to None (no projection).

        Requirements:
            1. Pre-computed teacher embeddings stored in a ``label`` column. For a single
               text column, shape ``(batch_size, teacher_dim)``. For multiple text columns
               with per-column teacher embeddings, shape ``(batch_size, num_columns, teacher_dim)``.
               2D labels with multiple text columns are broadcast (same teacher embedding
               targeted by every column, useful for multilingual distillation).

        Relations:
            - :class:`MSELoss` is a subclass that fixes ``distance_metric="mse"``. Use it
              when distilling into a model of the same dimension as the teacher (the classic
              monolingual-to-multilingual setup).
            - :class:`MarginMSELoss` and :class:`DistillKLDivLoss` perform *score-based*
              distillation rather than embedding matching. They distill teacher similarity
              scores, not teacher embeddings.

        Example:
            Pre-compute teacher embeddings for a single text column, then train::

                    "sentence": ["It's nice weather outside today.", "He drove to work."],
